# Integral Revolution

[Portuguese](./README.pt-br.md)

Welcome to my demonstration of various integration techniques for Solids of Revolution, tailored for my Calculus II class presentation.

For this presentation, I utilized **Manim** to create animations that illustrate several examples.

### Examples
* Lathe: Demonstrates the creation of a Solid of Revolution using a Lathe CNC.
* Disc Integration Method: Explains how the disc method works in forming a Paraboloid.
* Cylinder Integration Method: Illustrates the cylinder method by forming a Cone.
