# Integral Revolution

Welcome to my demonstration of various integration techniques for Solids of Revolution, tailored for my Calculus II class presentation.

For this presentation, I utilized **Manim** to create captivating animations that illustrate several examples. This approach helps in visualizing complex mathematical concepts with ease and clarity.

### Examples
* Lathe: Demonstrates the creation of a Solid of Revolution using a Lathe CNC, showcasing the practical application of these mathematical concepts.
* Disc Integration Method: Explains how the disc method works in forming a Paraboloid, providing a clear, step-by-step visual guide.
* Cylinder Integration Method: Illustrates the cylinder method by forming a Cone, offering insight into this essential technique.
